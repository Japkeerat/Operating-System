# Operating-System

In this repository you will find C codes to various algorithms used and generally taught during bachelor's degree course of Operating System.

The codes are divided according to the topics and directories are well named for easier and faster access. Every directory has its own README file giving details about the code and any other requirements.

I started learning C and these operating system algorithms less than 18 hours ago so there might be bugs, and better options to implement these algorithms. Therefore, you are free to make a report on issue tab provided it is well elaborated.

Contributions are open to all. Just make a pull request!

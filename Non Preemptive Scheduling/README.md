## Non-Preemptive Scheduling


Non-preemptive scheduling algorithms implementations are available here.

#### Algorithms implemented

SJF --> Shortest Job First

FCFS --> First Come First Serve

RR --> Round Robin

Priority Scheduling

#### Points to note:

* SJF and FCFS consider different arrival time for a process while RR and Priority programs do not. 
* SJF program doesn't pass all tests but most of the ones I tried.

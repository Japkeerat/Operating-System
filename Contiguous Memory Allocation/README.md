### Contiguous Memory Allocation

This directory holds all codes of contiguous memory allocation.

Algorithm names are self defined by the file name.

#### Points to consider:

* All these codes consider fixed memory block condition. Therefore, there would be internal fragmentation and amount of fragmentation is also displayed.
* There are minor bugs in the code section that is responsible for printing to the screen. Other than the processes that have been alloted memory, depending upon the number of processes and memory blocks, either of the remaining is displayed. If some process is not allocated and neither is some memory block provided to any process it would display message about one of the both.
